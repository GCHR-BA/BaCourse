# Retail Underground

Retail Underground is a set of business cases written by BA's in Coupang. Our goal is to bring more of our thinking to the wider audience and to showcase our analytical and research output. We hope to contribute to the wider debate on areas that are relevant to the eCommerce Business.

# How to Contribute? 

If you have worked on an interesting business decision and would like to share the approach, please feel free to send a pull request.

Ideally, the purpose of this to explain to a non tech person the data and the model behind the decisions. Which means:
* Do not write queries in the post. Provide a link to them stored in some github repo or redash or airflow. But avoid writing queries or python codes.
* Explain the rationale behind every assumption made. Why you made the assumption. What are the caveats of that assumption etc.
* Explain the rationale behind the model and why it makes sense.
* Use diagrams where necessary. Place all diagrams in the assets folder. 
* If possible explain the impact of the decision and the value the model added (optional).
* Where possible, explain the math/statistical tools you are using. Use Latex to make the formulas because it is easier for the reader to consume. 
* Place the Case/Business Model in the right category.
    * The category is defined by who is using that model to make the decision. So if your model is used by marketing team to do some discount, then place it in marketing.

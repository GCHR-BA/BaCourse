# Introduction

## A Glimpse Into Data Use Cases

In order for you to see how data is being used across many industries, you will see some examples.

Following each example, there is a short activity. These activities do not need to be submitted as a part of the project, but are a part of introducing you to the tools you will be learning about throughout this program!

Similar to the examples, your first project will include data from three entirely different use cases. There are three goals for this first project:

1. Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself. 

2. Understand how the review system works. The project review system is one of the absolute best aspects of this course, and it is the key to becoming a graduate. You must pass all the projects!

3. Glimpse into your future. By the end of this program, you will not only be able to draw conclusions from these dashboards, but you will be able to build dashboards for yourself just like the ones you see here in the first project!

The aim of this whole project is mostly to show you the process, but it is still required!

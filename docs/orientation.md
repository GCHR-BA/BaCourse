# Orientation

The purpose of this course is to efficiently help you gain the skills that the industry requires. So we focus on learning by doing. You will be completing a series of projects as you progress through the course. The course material will help you complete the porjects. 

If you already come with a lot of experience, please feel free to skip portions of the course that you already know.

-  To graduate, you need to pass every project. 
-  The videos, text lessons and quizzes are recommended but optional.
-  graduating depends primarily on your commitment and your persistence. 
-  Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work the problem. 
-  We are here to help, and so are your classmates. When you get stuck reach out to the community or the mentors. 
-  The most important feedback you get from mentors will be directly from your project reviews.
-  You will also find mentors, classmates and alumni on two platforms to get unblocked fast: Knowledge for searchable, upvoted Q&A, and Student Hub for real time collaboration.

# Submiting Projects

Once you finish a project, you can send it to us. You will receive feedback. Your evaluation will tell you if your submission has met the project specification or not and which concepts you might have to review. You can submit the projects any number of times till your submission meets the specifications.

We believe that projects are very important part of your learning process, because that process of getting feedback and making changes according to it is something you will face a lot in the real world. 

# Integrity and Mindset

You came here to learn. We want to make sure you do as much as that. You learn when you grapple with tough problems. To make this happen it is crucial you work on your projects by yourself. 

We encourage you to share what you have created with your community and you will have a chance to look at your peers work as well. But please be mindful of how other people's work influences your projects. 

# Scheduling Time for this Course

Think about when you'll be able to fit your Nanodegree program into your schedule. We recommend blocking off at least 3 or 4 separate learning sessions every week, with each one lasting 1 to 2 hours.

Please go into your calendar and schedule time to work on your Nanodegree for the next two weeks. Remember, consistent and frequent learning is the key to success!
